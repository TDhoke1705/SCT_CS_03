🔐 Password Strength Checker Tool

The Password Strength Checker is a lightweight and intuitive desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter. This tool helps users evaluate the strength of their passwords based on industry-standard criteria such as length, character variety, and the inclusion of special symbols.

🚀 Features
✅ Real-time password strength evaluation
✅ User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter

✅ Checks for:
Minimum password length (8 characters)
Presence of uppercase and lowercase letters
Inclusion of numbers
Use of special characters

🛠️ How It Works
The application assigns a score based on the password's composition and displays a strength rating as:

🔴 Weak
🟡 Moderate
🟢 Strong

🧠 Logic Behind Strength Calculation
python
Copy
Edit
if len(password) >= 8: strength += 1
if re.search(r"[A-Z]", password): strength += 1
if re.search(r"[a-z]", password): strength += 1
if re.search(r"[0-9]", password): strength += 1
if re.search(r"[\W_]", password): strength += 1
0–2 points → Weak

3–4 points → Moderate

5 points → Strong
